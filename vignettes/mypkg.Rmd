# Introduction

In the beginning there was `S`, before long came `R`. 
`R` provided an efficient language for statistical programming.
Amazing

# Colours

Sometimes you want to generate shades of a colour. The `make_shades()` function makes this easy! 

```{r}
shades <- make_shades("goldenrod", 5)
```

If you want to see what shades look like you can plot them using `plot_colors()`.

```{r}
plot_colours(shades)
```

This function is also useful for viewing an abritrary set of colours. 

```{r}
plot_colours(sample(colours(), 5))
```
